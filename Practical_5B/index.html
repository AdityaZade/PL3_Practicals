       <h4>What is Operating System ?</h4>
        <p>
          An operating system is a program on which application programs are
        executed and acts as an communication bridge (interface) between the user and the computer hardware.
        The main task an operating system carries out is the allocation of resources and services,
         such as allocation of: memory, devices, processors and information. The operating system
         also includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler,
         memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.
         An Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the
          user and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide a
           platform on which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.
        An operating system is a piece of software that manages the allocation of computer hardware.
        The coordination of the hardware must be appropriate to ensure the correct working of the computer system and
         to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper working of the system.
        Example: Just like a boss gives order to his employee, in the similar way we request or pass our
        orders to the Operating System. The main goal of the Operating System is to thus make the computer
         environment more convenient to use and the secondary goal is to use the resources in the most efficient manner.

          The operating system uses password protection to protect user data and similar other
           techniques. it also prevents unauthorized access to programs and user data.
        <strong>Control over system performance –</strong>
          Monitors overall system health to help improve performance. records the response
           time between service requests and system response to have a complete view of the system health.
           This can help improve performance by providing important information needed to troubleshoot problems.
          <strong>Job accounting –</strong>
          Operating system Keeps track of time and resources used by various tasks and users,
           this information can be used to track resource usage for a particular user or group of user.
        <strong> Error detecting aids –</strong>
          Operating system constantly monitors the system to detect errors and avoid the malfunctioning of computer system.
